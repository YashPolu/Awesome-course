Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **If you just created something, wait at least 30 days before submitting.** This is to give it some time to mature and ensure it's not just a publish-and-forget type of project.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Use [title-casing](http://title-casing.com).
- Use the following format: `[List Name](link)`.
- Suggested packages should be tested and documented.
- Make sure the list is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.

Thank you for your suggestion!
